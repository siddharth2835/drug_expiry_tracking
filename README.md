The 'Drug Expiry Tracking System' project focuses on an intelligent system for drug expiry tracking and redistribution in hospitals.
It monitors drug expiry dates, sends timely notifications for drugs nearing expiry (within 5 days), and redistributes half of such drugs to the nearest hospital to minimize wastage.
The system also discards expired drugs and updates records in real time.
With an interactive dataset and advanced mapping algorithms, this solution enhances hospital inventory management, promoting efficient use of medical resources.
